# Simple Trello Practice 
### Frontend: React, Boostrap
### Backend: Laravel
Trello unifies your tasks, teammates and tools. This web page is a simplified copy of what is the official Trello page. 
This page includes:
* Boards
* Rosters
* Tasks

It has the following functionalities:
* User(Login, Register)
* Respective CRUDS
* We can create our tables where they will have their respective rosters which will have their tasks. We can change tasks dynamically between rosters.
